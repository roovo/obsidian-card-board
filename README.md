An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to make working with tasks a pleasure
(hopefully anyway).

- Uses regular tasks/subtasks wherever they are in your vault.
- Shows them on kanban style boards.
- Two board types supported:
  - Date based (with daily/periodic notes support).
  - Tag based (uses `#tags` to define your boards).

## New
- Auto-generated column names (e.g. Untagged, Today, Completed...) can be customized.
- Honours global RTL mode set in obsidian.
- Clicking on any tag rendered on a card opens up the obsidian search for that tag.
- Works with the [Colorful Tag](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-colorful-tag)
  plugin. Adding this has changed the way tags can be customised using CSS Snippets.  See the
  [Customising Tags](#customising-tags) section below for info on what any snippets now
  need to look like to work with the latest version.

## Installation
Please install via the regular Community Plugins setting tab within Obsidian.

## Use
When installed, you can launch the plugin:

- using the icon in the app ribbon (see below), or
- using the Command Pallete command (which allows you to open a specific board).

![app ribbon icon](/images/ribbonIcon.png?raw=true)

If you have no boards defined, you should get a dialog asking you to add a new
board.  There are 2 types of board:

- **Date based**: looks like the main screenshot above.
- **Tag based**: uses tags to define the columns (you need to include tags on
  your tasks or in front matter for this to work).

Name and configure your boards and you are good to go.

## Cards
Any task in your vault can appear as a card in a column on a board.  In order to
do this, it must:

- Be in a markdown file.
- Not be indented.
- Have the format: `- [ ] Task title`. The format `* [ ] Task title` will also be recognised, but won't stay in that format when you edit the task.

What appears on the card depends on what your task looks like:

- Anything that is indented under a task will appear in the body of the task.
  - Indented tasks will appear as subtasks (all subtasks are grouped together).
  - Indented text will appear as notes.
- `#tags` in front matter or on the line of the task (or any subtasks) will
  appear at the top of the card.
- Due date (if given) will appear at the bottom of the card.

So, if you had the following in one of your markdown files:

```
- [ ] run erands @due(2022-12-02)
  - [x] do shopping #town
  - [ ] wash car #home/outside
  - [ ] cook dinner #home/kitchen

  perhaps I should look up some [[example_tasks/recipes|recipes]] first

  - [ ] do something with a long title that will truncate when displayed
  - [ ] go to bed
```

It will look something like this on a card on your board:

![example card](/images/card.png?raw=true)

#### Marking a task as complete
If you mark an task as complete on the board it will be marked as completed in the markdown
(and vice-versa).  If you mark as complete on the board, a completion timestamp is appended
to the task:

```
- [x] Task title @completed(2021-10-30T13:57:48)
```

See the [compatibility section](#other-plugin-compatibility) for details on how you can choose to use
a format compatible with other plugins.

If you have subtasks and the parent task is tagged as an _autocomplete_ task then the main
task will be marked as complete when you tick off the final subtask:

```
- [ ] Task title @autocomplete(true)
  - [ ] Do this first
  - [ ] Do this next
  - [ ] Finally do this and you are done
```

### Deleting a task
You can delete a task using the trash icon on the card.  This will not actually delete
the task from your vault, it simply surrounds it with markdown `<del>` tags:

```
<del>- [x] Task title</del>
```

### Editing tasks (and hover preview)
Click on the edit icon to open the file containing the task.  Cmd (or Ctrl on windows)
hover over the icon for the normal Obsidian hover preview.


### Column ordering
The current behaviour for the different columns is:

- **Completed**: has the most recently completed at the top (assuming they were
  marked as complete using the checkbox on the board).
- **Future**, **Today**, **Tags**: these are sorted by due date and then
  alphabetically within this.
- other columns are sorted alphabetically.

I am not convinced that this is the best strategy so this may well change in a future release.

### Customising Tags
I have to recommend using the wonderful
[Colorful Tag](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-colorful-tag) plugin as this
will allow you to style tags on your markdown pages as well as in CardBoard.

If you would like to "roll your own", you can using a CSS snippet containing something
along the lines of:

```css
.card-board-view a.tag[href="#foo/bar"] {
  background-color: HotPink;
  color: DimGrey;
}
```

This will style the tag `#foo/bar` wherever it appears in the CardBoard view with your favorite
color for foo/bars, which just has to be HotPink :)

## Date boards
You will get the best out of these if you are using the (core) Daily Notes
or the (community) Periodic Notes plugins, as any tasks you place on a daily
note will be assigned to the day of the note.

You can also assign a date to any task using the format:

```
- [ ] My task @due(2021-10-31)
```

Cardboard also understands the format used by Dataview and Tasks:

```
- [ ] My task [due:: 2021-10-31]
- [ ] My task ðŸ“… 2021-10-31
```


### Overdue tasks
These will appear in the `Today` column above any  any tasks that are actually
due today.

The idea being that it will get steadily more annoying to see what you were planning
to do today if you have a lot of incomplete tasks from previous days, (hopefully)
encouraging you to do something about them; like do them or move them to a future
date if you want to schedule them later.


## Tag boards
If you give your tasks tags, you can use these to set up a tag-board.  So if you
have the tags `#status/backlog`, `#status/triaged`, `status/blocked`, `#status/doing`,
you can define a board that shows tasks tagged with these in separate columns:

![tag board settingx](/images/tagBoardSettings.png?raw=true)

### Subtags
If you specify a tag with a trailing `/` then the column will contain all subtags of the tag.

### Front Matter Tags
If you want to give all the tasks on a page the same tag, you can put it in the
page front matter:

```
---
tags: [ project1 ]
---

# Project 1

- [ ] this task will automatically have a project1 tag
```

### Hiding Tags
If you don't want to see the tags used to configure the board's columns on the cards,
you can show/hide them in the settings.  If you choose not to show the column tags,
this will hide all the tags used in the settings wherever cards are on the board.
Only tags that exactly match those used in the settings will be hidden.

## Board Filters
You can filter which tasks appear on each board in the board settings.  There are 3
types of filter you can use: file, path, and #tags (which includes front matter tags).  You can
use any combination of these on a per-board basis.

You can also:

- Choose whether to use the filters as an allow or a deny list.
- Choose if you want any tags specified as a filter to be shown or
  hidden on cards on the board.

## Settings
Plugin settings are accessible from the plugin view itself, via the settings icon
above the board to the left of the tabs.  You can:

- Create new boards (using the + icon next to _BOARDS_).
- Configure your boards.
- Customize the names of the built-in columns.
- Delete any boards you no longer need.
- Choose whether to use Cardboard, Dataview or Tasks format for marking task completion.

The settings for your boards are saved in the

```
.obsidian/plugins/card-board/data.json
```

file inside your vault.  You may see some older versions (e.g. data.0.5.0.json) in there
as well.  These are saved when the internal version of the settings file is updated, just
in case something goes wrong!  If you want to ensure you never loose your CardBoard settings
then do ensure that your .obsidian directory is backed up.

## Other Plugin Compatibility
Cardboard is compatible with the *Due* and *Completion* date formats used in
both [Tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/)
and [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).
Dates from both of these are understood with no configuration.

When marking a task as complete, you can choose which format to use via
CardBoard's Global Settings:

![task completion format setting panel](/images/taskCompletionFormatSetting.png?raw=true)

You can also set this value to *None* if you don't want any completion date or timestamp adding
to a task on completion.  **This is not recommended** as if you do this, the task may well not
appear at (or near) the top of any completed column you have on your board when you mark
it as complete.  CardBoard uses this time or date so it knows which are the most
recently completed tasks so they can be shown at the top of the column.

### Dataview Plugin

```
- [ ] todo in Dataview format [due:: 2021-10-30] [completion:: 2021-10-29]
```

Will be read as a task with a due date of 30th Oct 2021 which was completed a day early.

Cardboard will honour the task related settings in Dataview, so if you set Dataview
to use emoji completion or a different "completion" string (such as "done") then
CardBoard will mirror this.

### Tasks Plugin

```
- [ ] todo in Tasks format ðŸ“… 2021-10-30 âœ… 2021-10-29
```

Will be read as a task with a due date of 30th Oct 2021 which was completed a day early.

#### Recurring Tasks
**CardBoard does not understand recurring tasks**, even if you have set it up to use Tasks
format for marking tasks as complete.   Checking off a recurring task from
the CardBoard board view will add the completion date in Tasks format but **will
not generate a new instance of the recurring task**.

To get the correct behavior for recurring tasks, click the edit icon on the card
to go to the file where the task is written, and then use the
*"Tasks: Toggle Done"* command or click the checkbox from there.

## Scaling Board Size
You can scale the size of the board relative to the size of stuff in Obsidian using
a css snippet:

```css
.card-board-view {
  font-size: 1em;
}

.card-board-view .card-board-columns {
  grid-auto-columns: minmax(20em, 1fr);
}
```

You can change the font-size to alter the general size of the contents of the cards.
If you change the value of the first parameter of the minmax function you can change
the minimum width of the cards.


## Limitations
- Might not work that great on large vaults (as it parses all markdown files at startup).
- Might not be great on mobile (see previous, plus I haven't made the interface mobile
  friendly - yet).

## Alternatives
If the way that this works isn't for for you, there are plenty of other fabulous
plugins you can use for task management in Obsidian, e.g.
[Checklist](https://github.com/delashum/obsidian-checklist-plugin),
[Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban),
[Reminder](https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder),
[Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks),
[Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects), as well as the
[Tasks Calendar snippet](https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar).
There are others too, see the wonderful
[Obsidian Plugin Stats site](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app).
